My name is Ren Sie. I’ve made a few commitments in my life:

- Build a career that allows me to work with computers
- To serve and protect others
- Join a government agency to give back to my country
- Stay healthy and work out regularly
- Enjoy life; a cup of coffee on the balcony in the morning, a pint of red/brown ale on the patio in the afternoon.
- Go on road trips and camping adventures with my partner

### My story

I started on a transformative journey in the beginning of 2023, transitioning from a background in hotel management to technology. After graduating in 2017, I spent several years developing my skills in the hospitality industry. However, my lifelong fascination with computers, which began in childhood as I snuck late-night gaming sessions, prompted me to explore a new career path. The pivotal encouragement from my friend and the unwavering support from my life partner, helped me take this significant step just before I turned 30.
