**Note:** ðŸ’¡ During the testing, use `print()` `prompt("text")` instead of `alert()` since `alert()` is commonly detected and filtered. <br> When testing for XXS, test for html injection first because itâ€™s more likely to work
E.g., \<h1\>test\</h1\>

### Checklist
<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Click me to expand checklist</summary>  

1. **Is input reflected in the response?**
2. **Can we inject HTML?**
   - E.g., `https[://]victim[.]com/search?user=<img src=x onerror=prompt("XSS")>`
4. **Any weaknesses in the Content Security Policy (CSP)?**
   - Use of unsafe directives which allow execution of inline scripts or eval() functions, bypassing CSP protections. <br> E.g.,`Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';`
   - Allowing broad sources or wildcards in directives (e.g., script-src), which permits potentially untrusted external scripts to run. <br> E.g., `Content-Security-Policy: script-src *;`
   - Inclusion of compromised or vulnerable third-party domains in trusted sources, such as JSONP endpoints that can be exploited to inject malicious scripts. <br> E.g., `https[://]third-party_domain[.]com/jsonp?callback=prompt("xss is available!")`
   - Omitting strict directives for resources like object-src or failing to restrict nonces and hashes properly which can allow script injection.
   - Weak or predictable nonces (e.g., 'nonce-12345') that attackers can guess or reproduce to bypass CSP restrictions.
6. **Can we use events (e.g. onload, onerror)?**
7. **Are there any filtered or escaped characters?**
8. **Is your input stored and then later rendered?**
9. **Can you inject into non-changing values (e.g. usernames)?**
10. **Any input collected from a third party (e.g. account information)?**
11. Is the version of the framework or dependency vulnerable?

### Reflected XXS
Inject payload into the HTTP request. And once the web server receive the request, it will response with the payload to senderâ€™s browser. It relies on URL to make user fall for the attack.

### Dom-Based XXS
Client-side has vulnerable JavaScript. It doesnâ€™t involve with the server-side, completely rely on clientâ€™s browser to execute the payload.
One quick check is turn on the developer tool, input and execute a simple prompt or alert script, see if thereâ€™s any network interaction with the server.

**Note:** ðŸš¨ Inspecting Network page in the developer tab while sending input. If thereâ€™s no external communication happens, it indicates it is Dom-Based XXS.

#### Page Redirect
User could inject the following code into a vulnerable website, causing an automatic redirect to a malicious site. When a victim loads the page with this injected script, they will be automatically redirected to <$url>.
~~~
src=x onerror="window.location.href='<$url>'"
~~~

### Store
Payload is stored in the database, and victimâ€™s browser will retrieve it once it visit the page. For instance:  
1. In the attackerâ€™s browser leave html injection comment: \<h1\>test\</h1\>.
2. Visit the same page from victimâ€™s browser
