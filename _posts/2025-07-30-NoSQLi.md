# NoSQLi

NoSQL injection is similar to SQL injection in that it allows an attacker to manipulate or inject malicious input into a NoSQL query to retrieve, modify, or delete data. However, the key difference lies in the database type and query language.

- SQLi:
    - SQL database (E.g., MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - Structure Query Language
- NoSQLi:
    - Semi-structured database (E.g., MongoDB, CouchDB)
    - JSON-like documents or key-value pairs.

# Types of NoSQLi

1. Syntax injection: Attacker injects an unclosed string literal (`'`), to break the query’s logic.
2. Operator injection: Attacker injects NoSQL operator (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$regex`, etc.) into the query, changing the query’s logic to return unintended results or bypass authentication.

# Lab

1. Detect NoSQLi, and retrieve hidden data.
    1. Using a single quote (') to break the query and trigger a server error.
    2. insert boolean/truthy expression payloads to manipulate the server response and reveal hidden items. 
        - GET /filter?category=Pets '||'1'=='1
        - GET /filter?category=Pets '||1|| '
2. NoSQL operator injection to bypass authentication 
    1. $regex operator to look for any username contain adm
    2. $ne operator to bypass password requirement.
    
    ```sql
    {"username":{"$regex":"adm.*"},"password":{"$ne":""}} 
    ```
